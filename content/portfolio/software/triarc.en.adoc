*Triarc* is a Python framework for connecting and automating multiple Instant Messaging platforms.
Its codebase currently includes support for two backends (Discord and IRC), with more planned to be 
added in the near future, and an easily etensible software architecture.

Basically, it allows the creation of bots, crawlers, and other forms of automation relating to said
IM platforms. It is a general purpose library, which is versatile and can be used for various projects,
such as minigames, online lookup utilities, intelligent automatic assistants with support to multiple
chat platforms, and many more things; or even all at once, thanks to the project's modularity.

This project was last updated on May 2022. Development is currently paused due to a planned rewrite into
the Rust programming language.
