= Loot & Roam

https://wallabra.github.io/proto-lnr

A physics-based naval battle simulation game with stealth elements, where you
invade islands, dodge or destroy enemy ships, steal loot, then escape the
island to a management screen where you can buy new ships, change parts, resell
& buy new items, and build your very own steampunk pirate fleet.

Currently in the prototype stage, which can be accessed via the navigation
bar at the top of the screen, or the above link, right now!
