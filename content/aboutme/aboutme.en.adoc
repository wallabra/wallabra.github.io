= About Me

Hello! My name is *Gustavo Ramos Rehermann*. Although my pseudonym is *wallabra*. And I was born May of 2003.

I am from and live in Brazil, in the city of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul.

I am passionate about a handful of things, but in particular _software development_, _soundtrack composition_,
and _graphic design_, and I hope to someday make it into a _game development studio_.

I also have other assorted interests, such as logistics, arts, photography and philosophy. You won't hear me
muse about those willy-nilly - although you can always ask me about these kinds of things directly if you want!

I also have autism and ADHD, but in both cases it is mild. I'm still fairly extroverted and communicative!

Any opinions on this website are my own.
